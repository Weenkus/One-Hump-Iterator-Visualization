### Introduction

Program for one hump iterator visualization. Allows the user to pick a one hump iterator and change the r value while visualizing the result. Four compositions of the iterator are shown to indicate fixed points inheritance between iterator composition. The leading iterator composition is always shown as the thickest line in the graph. Watch how every time a function loses its stability the next iterator composition takes over.

### How should I use the program?

If you want to alter/change/modify the program you need to clone this git repo.
The program is written in C# as Windows Forms application using the .NET Framework 4.6.

The program draws four compositions, of a function that the user chooses at the top of the form. 
Every function has a variable r and the user can change it by using the slider found on the bottom of the form.
The value of r is printed on the right of the graph together with all fixed points (FT) from all founction compositions.

f^2(x) represent the second composition of f(x), f^2(x) = f(f(x))

FT1 is the first fixed point of a function (or the composition)

FT2 is the second fixed point of a function (or the composition) and so on...

In the bottom right coner there are four check boxes witch allow the user to choose which compositions of the function f(x) will be shown.

### Executable

Here is the link to the lastest version of the exectuable for people that just want to run the
software without thinkering.

_Link will be added soon_
