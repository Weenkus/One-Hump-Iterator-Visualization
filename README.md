### Introduction

Program for one hump iterator visualization. Allows the user to pick a one hump iterator and change the r value while visualizing the result. Four compositions of the iterator are shown to indicate fixed points inheritance between iterator composition. The leading iterator composition is always shown as the thickest line in the graph. Watch how every time a function loses its stability the next iterator composition takes over.

### How should I use the program?

If you want to alter/change/modify the program you need to clone this git repo.
The program is written in C# as Windows Forms application using the .NET Framework 4.6.
